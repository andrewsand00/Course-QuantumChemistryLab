    "\n",
    "When we run a quantum chemistry computation we always need to find a compromise between speed and accuracy. One important variable that controls the speed of a computation is the basis set used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from class that a basis sets is a set of functions $\\{ \\chi_\\mu(\\mathbf{r})\\}$ used to approximate orbitals $\\phi_i(\\mathbf{r})$ as a linear combination\n",

    "In this problem you will evaluate several properties with the Karlsruhe series of basis functions\n",

    "Organize your data into a table. Report the frequencies in **decreasing** order (that is, Frequency 1 is the highest one).\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) Estimate the complete basis set limit\n",
    "To obtain converged Hartree–Fock energies and geometries you can estimate the complete basis set limit by an extrapolation procedure implemented in psi4.\n",

We will come back to open-shell species later in this course.\n",

Report the energies with 6 digits (in Hartree) and the EA with 3 digits (in units of eV) in the table provided.\n",
